# Analysis and figure generation for XSwap project

This repository hosts notebooks, images, and data for the XSwap project.
The results of these analyses are described in the manuscript titled:

[**The probability of edge existence due to node degree: a baseline for network-based predictions**](https://github.com/greenelab/xswap-manuscript/)<br>

Along with the manuscript, this project produced an open-source implementation of our network permutation algorithm.
Available on PyPI as [`xswap`](https://pypi.org/project/xswap/) and source on GitHub in [hetio/xswap](https://github.com/hetio/xswap/).
